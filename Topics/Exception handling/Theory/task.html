<h2>Exception handling</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>As you already know, an exception interrupts the normal execution of a program. Normally this is not what we want to happen. Luckily, it is possible to write some code that will handle the exception without stopping the whole program. To do that, Java provides an <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3497" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="Exception handling in Java is a method to manage and respond to unexpected conditions, or exceptions, that occur during program execution. | It allows the program to continue running instead of abruptly stopping. Java has a hierarchy of exception classes that can be caught and handled using the try-catch block, with the finally block ensuring certain code runs regardless of exception occurrence. The order of exception handling is important, with more specific handlers written before more general ones. Additionally, Java 7 introduced the multi-catch syntax for handling multiple exceptions in the same way.">exception handling</a></strong> mechanism that works with both <strong>checked</strong> and <strong>unchecked</strong> exceptions.</p>

Such a handler can be located in the same method where the exception occurred or in the calling method. As soon as a suitable handler is found and executed, the exception is considered as handled, and the program runs normally.</p>
<p>Technically, an exception can be handled in the method where it occurs or in the calling method. The best approach to handle an exception is to do it in a method that has sufficient information to make the correct decision based on this exception.</p>
<p>Let's now learn three keywords for handling exceptions: <code class="language-java">try</code>, <code class="language-java">catch</code> and <code class="language-java">finally</code>.</p>
<h5 id="the-try-catch-statement">The try-catch statement</h5>
<p>Here is a simple <code class="language-java">try-catch</code> template for handling exceptions:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">try {
    // code that may throw an exception
} catch (Exception e) {
    // code for handling the exception
}</code></pre>
<p>The <code class="language-java">try</code> block is used to wrap the code that may throw an exception. This block can include all lines of code, including <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/10982" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A method in Java is a self-contained block of code that performs a specific task. | It is a fundamental unit of functionality in Java, similar to a function in other programming languages. Methods are used to encapsulate code, making it reusable and modular. They can take inputs in the form of parameters, and return outputs. Methods can also be overloaded, allowing for multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. They are a crucial part of object-oriented programming, as they represent the behavior of objects and classes.">method</a> calls.</p>
<p>The <code class="language-java">catch</code> <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3533" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A block in Java is a group of statements enclosed in curly braces `{}`. | It is used to define a scope for variables and statements, and to group statements that should be executed together. Blocks can be used to define methods, constructors, initializer blocks, and control structures such as loops and if-else statements. The statements within a block are executed sequentially, and any variables declared within the block are only accessible within that block.">block</a> is a handler for the specified type of exception and all of its subclasses. This block is executed when an exception of the corresponding type occurs in the <code class="language-java">try</code> block.</p>

<p>Note that the specified <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3492" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a 'type' refers to a classification of data that determines the values it can hold and the operations that can be performed on it. | This can include primitive types (such as int, char, or boolean) and reference types (such as classes, interfaces, or arrays). Each type has a specific size and range of values it can represent, and the operations that can be performed on it are defined by the language. Understanding the different types in Java is essential for writing correct and efficient code, as well as for understanding the behavior of existing code.">type</a> in a <code class="language-java">catch</code> block must extend the <code class="language-java">Throwable</code> class.</p>
<p></p></div>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the presented template, the <code class="language-java">catch</code> block can handle exceptions of the <code class="language-java">Exception</code> class and all classes derived from it.</p>
<p>The following example demonstrates the <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/10982" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="Execution in Java refers to the process of running a program or method. | It involves the interpretation and execution of code by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Execution can involve both primitive and reference types, and it often involves the use of methods with return types and parameters. The execution of a program follows a specific order, determined by the call stack, which keeps track of method invocations and their corresponding information. The result of execution is typically the output or processing of data, depending on the logic implemented in the code.">execution</a> flow with <code class="language-java">try</code> and <code class="language-java">catch</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">System.out.println("before the try-catch block"); // it will be printed

try {
    System.out.println("inside the try block before an exception"); // it will be printed

    System.out.println(2 / 0); // it throws ArithmeticException

    System.out.println("inside the try block after the exception"); // it won't be printed
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.out.println("Division by zero!"); // it will be printed
}

System.out.println("after the try-catch block"); // it will be printed</code></pre>
<p>The output:</p>

inside the try block before an exception

<p>The program does not <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/13775" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, 'print' is a statement used to display output to the console. | It writes the specified text or variable value to the standard output stream, which is typically the console. Unlike 'println', 'print' does not add a newline character after the output, meaning that subsequent print statements will continue writing on the same line. It's a fundamental tool for providing feedback and displaying results in a Java program.">print</a> <code class="language-java">"inside the try block after the exception"</code> since the <code class="language-java">ArithmeticException</code> aborted the normal flow of the execution. Instead, it executes the print statement in the <code class="language-java">catch</code> block. After completion of the <code class="language-java">catch</code> block, the program executes the next statement (printing <code class="language-java">"after the try-catch block"</code>) without returning to the <code class="language-java">try</code> block again.</p>
<p>Replacing <code class="language-java">Exception</code> with <code class="language-java">ArithmeticException</code> or <code class="language-java">RuntimeException</code> in the <code class="language-java">catch</code> statement does not change the execution flow of the program. But replacing it with <code class="language-java">NumberFormatException</code> will make the handler unsuitable for the exception, and the program will fail.</p>
<p> </p>

<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary">
<p>As we noted earlier, the <code class="language-java">try-catch</code> statement can handle both checked and <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3570" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="An unchecked exception in Java refers to exceptions that are not checked at compile-time. | They are also known as runtime exceptions. These exceptions are not explicitly declared in a method's throws clause. Examples of unchecked exceptions include NullPointerException, ArithmeticException, and ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. Unchecked exceptions are typically caused by programming errors, and they do not need to be handled or declared in the method signature.">unchecked exceptions</a>. But there is a difference: checked exceptions must be wrapped with a <code class="language-java">try-catch</code> block or declared to be thrown in the method, while unchecked exceptions don't have to.</p>
<p></p></div>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h5 id="getting-info-about-an-exception">Getting info about an exception</h5>
<p>When an exception is caught by a <code class="language-java">catch</code> block, it is possible to get some information on it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">try {
    double d = 2 / 0;
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.out.println(e.getMessage());
}
// An exception occured: / by zero</code></pre>
<p>It is always possible to use a single handler for all types of exceptions:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">try {
    // code that may throw exceptions
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.out.println("Something goes wrong");
}</code></pre>
<p>Obviously, this approach does not allow us to perform different actions depending on the type of exception that has occurred. Fortunately, Java supports the use of several handlers inside the same <code class="language-java">try</code> block.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">try {
    // code that throws exceptions
} catch (IOException e) {
    // handling the IOException and its subclasses    
} catch (Exception e) {
    // handling the Exception and its subclasses
}</code></pre>
<p>When an exception occurs in the <code class="language-java">try</code> block, the runtime system determines the first suitable <code class="language-java">catch</code> block according to the type of the exception. Matching goes from top to bottom.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-warning">
<p>Important, the <code class="language-java">catch</code> block with the base class has to be written below all blocks with subclasses. In other words, the more specialized handlers (like <code class="language-java">IOException</code>) must be written before the more general ones (like <code class="language-java">Exception</code>). Otherwise, the code won't compile.</p>
<p></p></div>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Since Java 7, you can use a <strong>multi-catch </strong>syntax to have several exceptions handled in the same way:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">try {
    // code that may throw exceptions
} catch (SQLException | IOException e) {
    // handling SQLException, IOException and their subclasses
    System.out.println(e.getMessage());
} catch (Exception e) {
    // handling any other exceptions
    System.out.println("Something goes wrong");
}</code></pre>
<p>In the code above <code class="language-java">SQLException</code> and <code class="language-java">IOException</code> (alternatives) are separated by the <code class="language-java">|</code> character. They will be handled in the same way.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-warning">
<p>Note that alternatives in a multi-catch statement cannot be each other's subclasses.</p>
<p></p></div>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h5 id="the-finally-block">The finally block</h5>
<p>There is another possible block called <code class="language-java">finally</code>. All <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/9955" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a statement is a unit of code that performs a specific action. | It is a complete instruction that can be executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Statements are often used to declare variables, assign values, control the flow of a program, or call methods. They are typically terminated by a semicolon (;) and can be organized into blocks to define the scope and visibility of variables and methods. Understanding statements is crucial for writing clear and concise Java code.">statements</a> present in this block will always execute regardless of whether an exception occurs in the <code class="language-java">try</code> block or not.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">try {
    // code that may throw an exception
} catch (Exception e) {
    // exception handler
} finally {
    // code that will always be executed
}</code></pre>
<p>The following example illustrates the order of execution of the <code class="language-java">try-catch-finally</code> statement.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">try {
    System.out.println("inside the try block");
    Integer.parseInt("101abc"); // throws a NumberFormatException
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.out.println("inside the catch block");
} finally {
    System.out.println("inside the finally block");
}

System.out.println("after the try-catch-finally block");
// inside the try block
// inside the catch block
// inside the finally block
// after the try-catch-finally block</code></pre>
<p>If we remove the line that throws a <code class="language-java">NumberFormatException</code>, the <code class="language-java">finally</code> block is still executed after the <code class="language-java">try</code> block.</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">inside the try block
inside the finally block
after the try-catch-finally block</code></pre>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary">
<p>Interesting: the <code class="language-java">finally</code> block is executed even if an exception occurs in the <code class="language-java">catch</code> block.</p>
<p></p></div>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is also possible to write <code class="language-java">try</code> and <code class="language-java">finally</code> without a <code class="language-java">catch</code> block at all.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">try {
    // code that may throw an exception
} finally {   
    // code always be executed
}</code></pre>
<p>In this template, the <code class="language-java">finally</code> block is executed right after the <code class="language-java">try</code> block.</p>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>The <code class="language-java">try-catch</code> statement allows us to handle both checked and unchecked exceptions. </p>
<p>The <code class="language-java">try</code> block wraps the code that may throw an exception while the <code class="language-java">catch</code> block handles this exception in case it occurs, also allowing us to get some information about it.
